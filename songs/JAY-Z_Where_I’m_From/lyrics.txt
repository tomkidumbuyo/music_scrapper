<p>[Intro]



Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, 

How real is, this?

How real is, this? <i>(Brooklyn)</i>

Uh-huh huh  <i>(Brooklyn)</i>

Respect this here, check!



[Verse 1]

 











Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets







I'm from where the beef is inevitable, 







 

 



But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?



I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all



[Chorus]

 



 



 



 



 







[Verse 2]







Not enough shots away from stray shells





Where the liquor stores and the base dwell





And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens

Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies

So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?



 



 



[Chorus]

 



 



 



 



 







[Verse 3]





I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street

From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet

















[Chorus]
