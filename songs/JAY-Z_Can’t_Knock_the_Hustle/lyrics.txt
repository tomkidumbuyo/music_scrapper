[Break: Jay-Z]





[Verse 1: Jay-Z]

















 (brrrr)

















[Verse 2: Jay-Z]















What y'all don't know?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle







The way you make me feel





[Verse 3: Jay-Z]

















Straight bananas;  play fake rappers like a campus

 









I'm taking out this time

To give you a piece of my mind

Who do you think you are?

Baby one day you'll be a star

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?

'Cause that's the way you're making me feel

I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time

To knock the hustle for real
